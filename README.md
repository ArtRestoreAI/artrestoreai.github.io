# Website for the ArtRestoreAI project

Built using **Portfolio Jekyll Theme**

This is a Jekyll theme built using the [DevTips Starter Kit](http://devtipsstarterkit.com/) as a foundation for starting, and following closely the amazing tutorial by [Travis Neilson over at DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6jKLsxbFg4&list=PL0CB3OvPhDA_STygmp3sDenx3UpdOMk7P). The purpose of this theme is to provide a clean and simple website for your portfolio. Emphasis is placed on your projects, which are shown front and center on the home page.

Everything that you will ever need to know about this Jekyll theme is included in the README below, which you can also find in [the demo site](https://lenpaul.github.io/portfolio-jekyll-theme/). For a guide on how to deploy a Jekyll site using GitHub Pages, please check out [this article](https://paulle.ca/jekyll-tutorials/deploy-jekyll-site-github-pages).


## Introduction

Portfolio Jekyll Theme is a Jekyll theme that was built to be 100% compatible with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you are unfamiliar with GitHub Pages, you can check out [their documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) for more information. [Jonathan McGlone's guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) on creating and hosting a personal site on GitHub is also a good resource.

### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Basically, Jekyll takes your page content along with template files and produces a complete website. For more information, visit the [official Jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) for their documentation.

### Never Used Jekyll Before?

The beauty of hosting your website on GitHub is that you don't have to actually have Jekyll installed on your computer. Everything can be done through the GitHub code editor, with minimal knowledge of how to use Jekyll or the command line. All you have to do is add your posts to the `_posts` directory and edit the `_config.yml` file to change the site settings. With some rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS, you can even modify the site to your liking. This can all be done through the GitHub code editor, which acts like a content management system (CMS).


Pages are essentially the post layout without any of the extra features of the posts layout. An example of what pages look like can be found at the [About](https://lenpaul.github.io/portfolio-jekyll-theme/pages/about.html) and [Contacts](https://lenpaul.github.io/portfolio-jekyll-theme/pages/contact.html).

In addition to the two main layout options above, there is also a custom layout that have been created for the [home page](https://lenpaul.github.io/portfolio-jekyll-theme/). These are simply just page layouts with some [Liquid template code](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). Check out the `index.html` file in the root directory for what the code looks like.

Portfolio Jekyll Theme has been designed as a base for users to customize and fit to their own unique needs. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. Some examples of changes that I would love to see are things that would make the site easier to use, or better ways of doing things. Please avoid changes that do not benefit the majority of users.

Built using **Portfolio Jekyll Theme**





Pages are essentially the post layout without any of the extra features of the posts layout. An example of what pages look like can be found at the [About](https://lenpaul.github.io/portfolio-jekyll-theme/pages/about.html) and [Contacts](https://lenpaul.github.io/portfolio-jekyll-theme/pages/contact.html).

In addition to the two main layout options above, there is also a custom layout that have been created for the [home page](https://lenpaul.github.io/portfolio-jekyll-theme/). These are simply just page layouts with some [Liquid template code](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). Check out the `index.html` file in the root directory for what the code looks like.
